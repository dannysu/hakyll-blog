title: OneBusAway.org W3C widget
---
Since I used to take the bus to and from work everyday, the OneBusAway.org
real-time bus information was very useful to me. In Windows Mobile 6.5,
Microsoft implemented the [W3C widgets spec][1] to allow developers to use web
technology to create apps for the platform. There was an internal contest that
went on before the feature was released, and I implemented a OneBusAway.org
widget to provide easy and better UI to access the real-time bus information. I
won the internal contest and got a free phone, but the biggest reward for me
was that I was able to track where the bus is.

I used AJAX to load information from OneBusAway.org and showed progress
indicator while user waits for the results as shown in screenshots below. Soft
key menus like the one shown in the first screenshot were implemented using
JavaScript.

One of the very fun part of the project was the fact that I was actually able
to work on the widget while I was taking public transit. Since it's all just
client side scripting, I was using my smartphone and a text editor on it to
write parts of the widget.

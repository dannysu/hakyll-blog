title: Home Screen Customizer for Windows Mobile
---
In 2009, Microsoft launched Windows Marketplace for Mobile. After some
brainstorming to figure out what I could contribute to it, I settled on the
idea of writing a touch friendly UI for customizing the Windows Mobile 6.5 home
screen. I went ahead and developed a tool that is easy to use and achieved
great success on the Marketplace.

My app was bundled by Microsoft to ship on all Huawei C8300 devices in China
(See more about that [here][1]). On top of that, there were other efforts
inside my team where people used my app as a reference to develop their
features.

As of July 21, 2010, the application has 151,116 downloads. It was the 11th
most popular application in the US market:

At one point in time, my app was chosen as one of the Showcase apps that
Microsoft hand picked:

Originally I only have English version of the program, but after I released the
first version people really loved it and offered to translate it. In the end,
with help of volunteers' translation I managed to release the application out
in 19 different regions on the Marketplace!

title: Home Screen Customizer for Windows Mobile
---
In 2009, Microsoft launched Windows Marketplace for Mobile. After some
brainstorming to figure out what I could contribute to it, I settled on the
idea of writing a touch friendly UI for customizing the Windows Mobile 6.5 home
screen. I went ahead and developed a tool that is easy to use and achieved
great success on the Marketplace. This entire project was done during my spare
time for fun, but the things that I learned and the program that I developed
ended up being beneficial to the company.

My app was bundled by Microsoft to ship on all Huawei C8300 devices in China
(See more about that [here][1]). On top of that, there were other efforts
inside my team where people used my app as a reference to develop their
features.

As of July 21, 2010, the application has 151,116 downloads. It was the 11th
most popular application in the US market:

At one point in time, my app was chosen as one of the Showcase apps that
Microsoft hand picked:

Originally I only have English version of the program, but after I released the
first version people really loved it and offered to translate it. In the end,
with help of volunteers' translation I managed to release the application out
in 19 different regions on the Marketplace!

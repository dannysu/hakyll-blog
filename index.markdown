title: Hello!

My name is Danny Su. I'm a software engineer at Facebook.

Previously I was the CTO and one of the founders of Kash Corp (YC S14), which
was acquired by a publicly traded financial services company. Before starting
my company, I worked at Microsoft on Windows Phone. I also worked at Canadian
start-up Well.ca and led their mobile apps and warehouse software efforts.

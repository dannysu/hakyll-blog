It took me a while to find the solution to this, so I'm blogging to
hopefully help other people find it. If you are getting the following error
message during Apple App Store validation, then see the solution below.

# Validation Error

# Solution

I found the solution in a github issue discussion [here][1]. Credits to [David
Casali][4].

I'm mirroring the solution David posted here:

This issue was tricky because I had all the right images and dimensions as per
Apple documentation (Default.png, Default@2x.png, Default-568h@2x.png). I put
them into the LaunchImage asset catalog, but couldn't figure out why it still
fails to validate.

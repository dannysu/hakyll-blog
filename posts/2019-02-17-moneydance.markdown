[Moneydance][1] is a personal finance software that helps to track your money
and investments. There is no subscription cost. Once I paid for the software I
own it forever. It's cross-platform so for a person that uses multiple OS,
including Linux on desktop, it's perfect for me. My wife can use it too and we
keep track of our finances with it. It's one of those software that I'm happy
to pay for.

Recently I found out that there is a new 2019 release and that there's a 50%
discount for 2015 license holders. My 2015 Moneydance copy is still good and
works fine, but I decided to upgrade to 2019 to get the new improvements and
also to keep supporting a software that I like.

What I like the most about the new version is the improved performance. The
2015 version kept every change made in a bunch of small files, which made
opening and closing of the app slower. With the 2019 version the speed is much
quicker!

The company behind Moneydance, The Infinite Kind, apparently also made
[DuckDuckGo's iOS and Android apps][2]. That's pretty cool.

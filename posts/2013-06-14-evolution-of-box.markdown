Two months have rapidly went by since I last talked about [AvidTap][1] in more
detail. A lot has happened since April.


# AvidTap Box

Take our hardware for example, we've done several iterations for the AvidTap
box. It went from a breadboard on my desk to a 3D-printed version, to a much
more polished version. Aside from the exterior, the innards have also seen some
changes and we brought the cost down even more.

Just like when I was working on Windows Phone I love the feeling of having
something tangible in my hands. Smartphone does that for me, and in this case
the AvidTap box feels awesome. It's even a physical thing that I can show my
parents.


# AvidTap Sticker

Similarly our sticker design has also been improved. We went from something that
Kaz threw together quickly to something much more fun.

# Improved Facebook Login

The AvidTap app had Facebook login feature for quite a while, but its use was
minimal. However, things changed after we did a re-design.

In the beginning, I believed that it was because people are hesitant about
logging in with Facebook. Even my own cousin didn't want to do that with me
sitting right beside her. Personally I wouldn't login via Facebook until I've
verified via a proxy that it really is Facebook an app is talking to. I'm
paranoid like that.

Geoff sent out a [link][2] on a great login screen. We've since then changed the
initial screen taking some of the points mentioned. Since then we've seen steady
increase in people logging in using Facebook. That cuts down on the number of
people who fat-finger their email address.


# Providing Value

During this time we've also sent out our analytics report and received great
feedback. For one of the stores the owner actually puts it into immediate use!
We showed him who his top customers are, and the next day when one of them came
back the owner gave her some freebies. What an awesome way to reward your best
customer and make them feel special.

One time while I was in one of our partner stores setting up our new box, I saw
a customer came in and launched the AvidTap app to tap in. It's an awesome
feeling to see people use it for real!

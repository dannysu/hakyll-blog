Great news! The AvidTap team pulled the trigger on launching v1 of Kash to the
broader world yesterday. Visit [withkash.com][1] and download the app from App
Store or Play Store. At the moment we support paying friends and family in the
app but our vision is to bring the same capabilities into stores. Stay tuned for
that.

What an insane couple months it's been since we [told the world about Kash][2]
at Dx3. As a team we did some herculean feat. With my co-founder Geoff on money
transfer backend, my friend Steve on Android app, Pritesh on API and me on
iPhone app, we submitted a MVP to App Store in a week. That's 1 week from
written plan to executed MVP! All I can say is that I went home at 8:30AM one
day trying very hard to push MVP out the door.

It took some back and forth with Apple asking clarification for what we do
before the app was allowed into App Store. I guess not many people out there
trying to do what we're doing. Unfortunately we still had to delay the rollout
due to us waiting on some legal processes. But it feels great to finally unleash
it now.

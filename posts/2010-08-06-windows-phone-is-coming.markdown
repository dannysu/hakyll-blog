It’ll be in stores this year, and people will get to experience the cool stuff
my team and I made. Some of the very things that I coded are pointed out in
this [preview][1] as highlights.

Engadget reviewers particularly liked the directions list view in Maps, which
is one of the things I worked on for WP7 :)

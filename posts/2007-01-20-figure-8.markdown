As Peter said to me, "You're addicted to real-time or something". Haha, that's
because I'm in the lab every time he enters. However, I also have some cool
stuff for show including the figure 8 video below. As fun as real-time is, I
had stopped working on cs452 assignment 1 for several days because I was busy
with 4th year design project. Some others have worked right up till the
assignment deadline. I had to work early to deal with the FYDP schedule.

Playing with trains is fun. It's even more satisfying once you understand more
about the hardware and how and why things work. My program is guaranteed not to
lose clock ticks. It does figure 8 AND it honks AND blinks lights. What more do
you want?!

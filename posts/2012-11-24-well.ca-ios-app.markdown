Got a message from Ali Asaria couple days ago to let me know that Well.ca's iOS
app officially launched! Watch the promo video [here][1] and see the Cupboards feature
that we made. If you have an iPhone or iPad, go check it out!

This was the last project that I worked on before leaving Well.ca to start a
start-up. It's great to see that it officially launched. Congrats to the team on
an awesome app.

This means we'll get tighter integration of apps!

Although still a work-in-progress, some code has already been checked in to
GNOME CVS. At this time I can get simple apps running without any problem:

More information can be found at [Imendio AB's website][1].  
Here's the [announcement][2].

Having to run GTK apps using Apple's X11 environment has always bugged me, and
I didn't know any better. Although the apps work, they are isolated in this
special environment that's separate from the rest. For example, I can't do the
normal Command+Tab keys to cycle through them.

The GTK application that I use the most is [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/). I
tried to get it working but no luck yet There are whole bunch of FIXME's and
things left to code in the project, but I think it's looking very promising. I
will likely shift my focus to this project now too. My aim would be to get GIMP
running flawlessly. To get to that stage, I'd need to do quite a bit of hacking
and also help contributing to the project effort to implement some of those
FIXMEs.
